# React-Redux-Shop
I want to present you a live version of [React-Redux-Shop](https://react-redux-firebase-app.netlify.app).

This project has helped me understand how to work with redux-toolkit. I know that a better option might be to use React Context, but I want to improve my understanding of redux.

I also want to understand how to work with database, so I decided to use Firebase with an authentication and real-time database. I used for the first time MUI as an alternative to CSS.

The project is not done yet. I need to correct some small mistakes. I didn't focus here on the best look, so don't be surprised :P

I'd describe this project as a full-stack because the user can log in and add products to the cart or favorites, which are connected to the database.
